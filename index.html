      <br /><br />
      <li>
        Use the lug wrench to fully tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern. This
        ensures that the tire is secured evenly. <br />
        tighten the lug nuts well but not over tighten them as this might put
        stress on the lugs and might get broken in the future.
